🎓 Online Quiz Management System

A fully web-based Quiz Management System built as a B.Tech final year project, powered by C++ logic running directly in the browser via a clean single-file architecture — no server setup required.


📌 About The Project
This project is a complete Quiz Management System that runs entirely in the web browser. The core business logic — scoring, grading, leaderboard sorting, time bonus calculation, and input validation — is written in C++ and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) using Emscripten, allowing native C++ code to execute directly inside the browser at near-native speed.
The system supports two roles — Admin (create and manage quizzes) and Student (take quizzes and view results) — with a fully responsive, modern UI.

✨ Features

🔐 Student Login System — name-based session management
🛠️ Admin Panel — create, edit, and delete quizzes
❓ Dynamic Quiz Builder — add MCQ questions with 4 options, marks, and explanations
⏱️ Live Countdown Timer — auto-submits when time expires
🎯 Randomized Question Display — questions shuffled on every attempt
📊 Auto Scoring & Grading — C++ calculates score, grade (A+ to F), and time bonus
🏆 Leaderboard — sorted by score then by fastest time (C++ std::sort)
📁 Persistent Storage — all data saved using browser localStorage
📖 Answer Review — see correct answers and explanations after submission
📱 Fully Responsive — works on desktop and mobile browsers

📐 Grading System (C++ Logic)
Score (%) = (Marks Earned / Total Marks) × 100 + Time Bonus
Time Bonus = (1 - time_used / time_limit) × 5   [max +5 points]

Grade Scale:
  90% and above  →  A+  (Outstanding)
  80% – 89%      →  A   (Excellent)
  70% – 79%      →  B   (Good)
  60% – 69%      →  C   (Average)
  50% – 59%      →  D   (Below Average)
  Below 50%      →  F   (Fail)




📚 Learning Outcomes

✅ Understanding of WebAssembly and how C++ runs in the browser
✅ Integration of C++ logic with a web frontend via Emscripten
✅ Application of OOP — classes, encapsulation, and abstraction
✅ Practical use of STL — vectors, maps, algorithms
✅ File handling and persistent data storage concepts
✅ Dynamic HTML generation driven by backend C++ logic
✅ CGI execution model understanding for traditional server-side C++
✅ Web server configuration and local deployment


🔮 Future Improvements

 Compile full C++ backend to WebAssembly for 100% native execution
 Add user authentication with encrypted passwords
 Support multiple question types (True/False, Fill in the blanks)
 Export results as PDF
 Add MySQL database backend using C++ connectors
 Deploy on cloud server (AWS / Heroku)
